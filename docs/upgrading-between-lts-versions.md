# Upgrading Between LTS Versions

When upgrading between LTS versions of SonarQube (as an example, going from 6.7.x to 7.9.x) it will be necessary to first upgrade to all the intermediary LTS versions.
Even doing so, it is possible that the upgrade will cause the existing reports to be lost, therefore forcing the scan history to start over from a clean state.

For more information on this topic, please refer to the [upgrading SonarQube docs](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/setup/upgrading/).
